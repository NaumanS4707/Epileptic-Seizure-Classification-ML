# Epileptic Seizure Classification ML Project

## Overview
This project implements machine learning algorithms to classify epileptic seizure states based on EEG data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training of models including Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM.

## Dataset
The EEG dataset contains recorded signals labeled for seizure and non-seizure states. Due to size, the full dataset is available upon request or linked externally.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce results.
4. Launch the Streamlit app (if included) with:  
   `streamlit run app.py`

## Results
The project achieves high classification accuracy validated by cross-validation and confusion matrices.
