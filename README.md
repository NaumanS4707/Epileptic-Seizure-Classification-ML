# Epileptic-Seizure-Classification-ML
Machine learning project for classifying epileptic seizure states using EEG data. Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and implementation of classification algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM for accurate seizure activity recognition. Also features data visualization and an interactive Streamlit interface.
